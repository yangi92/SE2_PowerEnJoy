\subsection{Entry Criteria}
The \textbf{Integration tests} are meant to be developed and conducted only after \textbf{single units} have been successfully and thoroughly tested ,with particular regard towards those parts involving intermodule communication.\\


\subsection{Elements to be Integrated}
From what we can infer from the previous documents , the to-be tested platform
used the \textbf{client-server paradigm} as its main architecture with the addition of intra module communication , especially in the \textbf{back-end system} where the \textit{business logic} lies, and direct communication happening back and forth on separate channels between the \textbf{back-end} and the \textbf{client-side applications.} \\
